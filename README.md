# ns_ros
This package implements a bridge between the [Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org/) (ROS), and the excellent [Nerfstudio](https://docs.nerf.studio/en/latest/) package. Our goal is to provide a minimal and flexible starting point for robotics researchers to explore possible applications of neural implicit represetations.  

## Requirements
- A linux machine (tested with Ubuntu 20.04)
	- This should also have a CUDA capable GPU, and fairly strong CPU.
- ROS Noetic installed on your linux machine
- A camera that is compatible with ROS Noetic

## Installation  
In our experience when it comes to software in robotics solutions are rarely one size fits all. To that end we cannot provide meticulous installation instructions that we will be sure will work for every robotics platform that this package might be used on. Rather we will try to outline the core components that you will need to get ROS working with Nerfstudio, and hopefully that will get you started on the road to creating some cool NeRFs with your robot.
